  This sample demonstrates basic service worker registration. During the installation step, a
  custom "Sorry, you're offline." page is cached. The service worker handles all fetch requests
  for HTML pages (ignoring other requests), and if fetching an HTML page fails due to a network
  error, it will instead return the cached "offline" page.

  Try disconnecting from your network, and then reload this page.
